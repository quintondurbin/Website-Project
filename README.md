Hickory Pit Website 
Hickory Pit 
Quinton Durbin, Brandon Grooms, and Clark Dennis

The picture on the Homepage is a link that takes you to a Google Map Street View in front of the restaurant.  
There is no “Menu.html” because the link opens straight into the first menu item page.
Semi mobile compatible 
Looks similar in almost all browsers
Had some problems with Internet Explorer but later fixed them 
Had issues with media queries 
Looks best on Google Chrome
Links works smoothly. Twitter and Facebook logos are linked to their respective platforms.
When you click the phone number on mobile it will call the Hickory Pit.
